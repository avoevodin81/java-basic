    /*
    Create 5 constructors
    1. Name
    2. Name, weight, age
    3. Name, age. (weight should be standard)
    4. weight, color. (name, address and age are unknown. Cat is homeless)
    5. weight, color, address

    Each constructor should create the valid object.
    For example, if we don't know weight, we should specify some kind of standard weight.
    Because cat cannot weight anything
    The same with age
    But it cannot have name(null) and address(null)
